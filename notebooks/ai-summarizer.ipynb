In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets, and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the Magnificent Seven. And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top.\\nA quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it’s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips.\\nIts most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday.\\nThere’s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings.\\nBut when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains — a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period — weren’t what they used to be.\\nNvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\\nAI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware.\\n“We are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,” Creative Strategies’ director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report.\\nOn the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they’re spending on AI hardware.\\nNvidia’s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer’s Jacob Bourne.\\nSign in to access your portfolio\"}, {'title': 'Amazon.com, Inc.

The company\\'s graphics processing unit (GPU) chipsets are perhaps the single most important piece of architecture used in generative AI.\\nDon\\'t believe me? Industry research suggests that Nvidia held 98% of GPU shipments over the last two years; meanwhile, Jon Peddie Research estimates that Nvidia owns 88% of the GPU market. With a stat line like this, is it fair to say that Nvidia is the best AI opportunity out there? Maybe.\\nBut considering shares of Nvidia have gained more than 800% over the last two years, I\\'m inclined to think the music is going to slow down at some point. Below, I\\'m going to outline two AI opportunities that I think are poised to break out over the next several years and give Nvidia a run for its money. Let\\'s dig in!\\nThe first company on my list of top AI stocks is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 0.63%). Over the last couple of years, AMD has been frequently benchmarked against Nvidia -- a comparison that I don\\'t find to be particularly apples-to-apples.\\nSince the dawn of the AI boom, Nvidia\\'s primary source of growth has come from its H100 and H200 GPUs. As I alluded to above, Nvidia\\'s one-two punch GPU architecture helped the company acquire nearly the entire market. While Nvidia\\'s compute and networking products are indeed quite powerful, one thing that also helped the company gain such an enormous lead in the marketplace was a lack of competition.\\nAMD has been quietly building its own GPU empire over the last year or so, but it\\'s nowhere near the size of that of Nvidia. In my eyes, that could soon change. AMD\\'s answer to Nvidia\\'s H100 and H200 GPU combo is its own chip accelerator dubbed MI300. When the MI300 launched earlier this year, AMD\\'s management was guiding for revenue around $2 billion. But during the company\\'s third-quarter earnings call a few weeks ago, AMD CEO Lisa Su hinted that the MI300 is scaling so quickly that the company\\'s data center GPU business is now on pace for $5 billion in sales this year.\\nThe best part about this is that many of AMD\\'s major customers adopting the MI300 architecture are also customers of Nvidia. When you layer on top that there could be more than $1 trillion of AI infrastructure spend over the next few years, AMD looks well-positioned to continue capturing incremental market share as it scales its data center GPU operation.\\nYet despite the positive narrative, AMD stock doesn\\'t seem to be getting much love. Right now, AMD shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 27.1 -- far lower than Nvidia\\'s forward P/E ratio of 36.1.\\nI think investors are missing the forest for the trees when it comes to investing in AMD. While I don\\'t think the company is going to speed past Nvidia by any means, I do think AMD has an opportunity to gain momentum as it releases next-generation GPU products and becomes a more serious competitor to Nvidia over time.\\nI think AMD\\'s valuation relative to Nvidia suggests that investors are discounting the company\\'s future growth prospects. In my eyes, AMD stock looks reasonable at these levels, and I think it is a compelling buy for investors with a long-term time horizon.\\nIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.\\nNext up on my list is one of Nvidia\\'s peers in the \"Magnificent Seven,\" Amazon (AMZN -0.64%). While Amazon is primarily known for its e-commerce marketplace, the company is also a dominant force in cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is on pace to generate over $100 billion in revenue this year. What\\'s even better is that AWS\\' operating profits are accelerating even faster than sales.\\nThis dynamic has equipped Amazon with tens of billions in free cash flow and a balance sheet that boasts $88 billion in cash and equivalents. Although this is encouraging, I think the party is just getting started. Amazon is aggressively deploying its profits into a number of capital expenditure (capex) investments -- namely, billion-dollar data center infrastructure projects in combination with building its own in-house training and inferencing chips.\\nThat\\'s right, Amazon is building its own chips. Candidly, I think this is a development that gets very little coverage, and one that has become entirely overshadowed by Nvidia\\'s narrative. Along the same lines as AMD, I think Amazon\\'s pursuit of the chip market could become a headwind for Nvidia in the long run. As more GPU architecture is introduced to the market, it\\'s reasonable to believe that Nvidia\\'s grasp on top pricing power will weaken, thereby resulting in decelerating revenue and profit margins.\\nAI represents a lucrative opportunity for Amazon to further strengthen its various business segments, and yet its valuation suggests the opportunity is not really baked into the company\\'s outlook.\\nI think AI will help Amazon become an even more efficient, profitable business in the long run. But right now, Amazon is trading at historically cheap levels on a price-to-free cash flow basis. I think Amazon is an underrated opportunity in the AI realm, and one that is trading at too much of a bargain to pass up right now.\\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\\'s board of directors.

While the company played key roles in pioneering the e-commerce and cloud computing industries, its market cap is now around $2.1 trillion. Given its massive size, investors could reasonably wonder whether relatively smaller growth stocks would make better investments now.\\nYet further research shows why investors should not write Amazon off as a mature, slow-growth stock just yet. Three factors indicate that it can still deliver market-beating returns despite its size.\\nFirst, investors should understand that they should not look to Amazon's online sales business for rapid expansion. With that part of the business logging single-digit percentage revenue growth for the past several quarters, it is likely not driving increases in Amazon stock.\\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a different story. It continues to be the cloud infrastructure industry's leader. Additionally, its ability to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and run AI workloads gives it a critical role in today's tech industry.\\nMoreover, its revenue for the first three quarters of 2024 grew by 18% to $79 billion, outpacing the company's 10% overall growth. Most importantly, 62% of Amazon's operating income came from AWS, demonstrating why it's arguably the most critical segment to the company's growth story.\\nNonetheless, it is likely not the only part. Within its North America and international segments, it operates digital advertising businesses, third-party seller services, and subscription services that are growing revenues at double-digit percentage levels. Although Amazon does not reveal the separate operating incomes of these businesses, they are likely helping to drive the company's growth.\\nNot surprisingly, the benefits of Amazon's growth businesses extend to its balance sheet. The company's liquidity is a staggering $88 billion, a level matched by few other companies.\\nAdmittedly, the $58 billion Amazon carries in long-term debt diminishes that liquidity somewhat. Still, it is largely low-interest debt with maturity dates decades into the future. Thus, one can assume that Amazon will probably earn returns from its cash and equivalents stockpile that exceed the interest rates it's paying, which should further bolster its balance sheet.\\nMoreover, Amazon generated $48 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. Cash flows at those levels give it tremendous flexibility to invest in its enterprises or buy new businesses without diminishing its liquidity. Thus, Amazon can afford to maintain its leadership positions in the cloud and AI while it continues to innovate in the businesses tied to e-commerce.\\nWhile it continues to innovate, one sign that the company may have begun to mature is its valuation. Amazon stock historically traded at elevated P/E ratios as it either took losses or accepted reduced profitability to invest more capital back into its businesses. So investors used to Amazon trading at P/E ratios of between 50 and 120 may be surprised to find that its earnings multiple has fallen to about 43.\\nMoreover, that has happened during a period when the company is reaping the benefits of its investments. In the first nine months of 2024, the company's net income was $39 billion, almost twice as much as its profit of $20 billion during the same period last year.\\nAnalysts believe its net income growth will slow to 20% in 2025. Still, given Amazon's history of high valuations, investors may want to capitalize on today's lower earnings multiple by adding shares.\\nUltimately, instead of viewing Amazon's massive market cap as a reason to treat it as a value stock, investors should continue to buy Amazon for growth.\\nDespite its overall size, Amazon includes AWS and many comparatively smaller growth businesses that can keep its revenue growth in the double-digit percentages. Moreover, its staggering liquidity and free cash flow should help keep these businesses and any future enterprises it pursues vibrant.\\nFinally, Amazon's valuation has fallen relative to its P/E ratios of the past. With its revenue and earnings growth expected to remain robust, growth investors can likely still beat the market by buying and holding Amazon stock.\\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency.

Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe’s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.\\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Meanwhile, many of its peers have struggled with inflation and weak consumer spending.\\nWalmart reported another round of strong quarterly results on Tuesday morning. Top-line growth was strong across the board with comparable-store sales (comps) up 5.3% at U.S. stores (excluding fuel), its best performance in at least five quarters. And Sam's Club, its members-only warehouse retail chain, reported 7% comps growth excluding fuel.\\nAt its international segment, which has historically been a challenging segment for the company, constant-currency revenue rose 12.4% to $30.3 billion. Overall, revenue was up 5.5% to $169.6 billion, which topped the consensus at $166.6 billion.\\nThe retailer also delivered solid margin improvement, with gross margin increasing 21 basis points to 24.2%, driven by lower markdowns in U.S. stores and strong inventory management. Overall operating margin expanded as well, as operating income was up 8.2% to $6.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose from $0.51 to $0.58, ahead of the consensus at $0.53.\\nWalmart's stores performed well, but it's also benefiting from emerging growth businesses like advertising, where revenue jumped 28%, and global e-commerce remains strong with sales up 27% as it gains market share on Amazon and other competitors.\\nThe company also raised its guidance, showing increased confidence in the holiday quarter. It now expects net sales to rise 4.8% to 5.1% and full-year adjusted EPS of $2.42 to $2.47.\\nIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGE.\\nWalmart's market cap topped $700 billion for the first time on Tuesday, Nov. 19, meaning the company is approaching a $1 trillion market cap. At its current valuation, the stock would only have to grow by 43%, which seems achievable given its recent momentum. The stock is now up 66% year to date, though it will be difficult to repeat that performance next year.\\nAt this point, the biggest risk to the stock appears to be its valuation. Based on its EPS guidance for this year, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 35, which is well above most of its retail peers, and puts it in league with the big tech companies that make up the trillion-dollar club like Microsoft and Apple.\\nWalmart has earned that premium thanks to its recent execution and its track record of steady growth and expanding margins. Ten years ago, many thought the company would be elbowed aside by Amazon, but it has responded to the challenge by building out its omnichannel business, tapping new growth opportunities like advertising, and strengthening its competitive advantages in areas like price and convenience.\\nAs Walmart's valuation has soared, its dividend yield has fallen to just 1%, but the company's track record of dividend hikes is unmatched by any company in the trillion-dollar club. It has raised its dividend annually for 51 years in a row, making it a Dividend King.\\nWalmart's third-quarter earnings report was virtually flawless, and it's a reminder to investors that the company still enjoys several competitive advantages, such as economies of scale; a recession-proof business model that leans toward food and groceries; and growth opportunities in advertising, e-commerce, and beyond.\\nThe stock might seem expensive at its current valuation, but the company has just proved its ability to grow in a difficult environment.

Since then, several more have hit that milestone, including several of Apple's peers in the tech industry: Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, and Meta Platforms. This group remains highly exclusive, but many more corporations will join in the coming years. One of them could be Shopify (SHOP 0.45%), an e-commerce specialist currently sporting a market cap of $135 billion.\\nShopify needs a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of at least 14.3% in the next 15 years to become a trillion-dollar stock. That's not an easy task, but let's find out why Shopify can pull it off.\\nShopify was created to address a real pain point for businesses trying to open online storefronts, which sometimes had to deal with design challenges, lack of flexibility, and other issues. Shopify changed that. The e-commerce specialist offers practically everything merchants need all in one spot, from hundreds of customizable templates and payment processing to inventory, social media tools, marketing, and more.\\nFurther, there is a built-in system that gives merchants many more options. Shopify's app store is home to thousands of apps that cater to its customers' ultra-specific needs. Since its 2015 IPO and with co-founder Tobias Lütke at the helm, Shopify has grown at a CAGR well above what it would need in the next 15 years to become a trillion-dollar stock.\\nSHOP TOTAL RETURN LEVEL DATA BY YCHARTS.\\nThere is some evidence in the academic literature that founder-led companies in the S&P 500 outperform the rest. It's hard to argue that point when looking at the list of trillion-dollar companies. Nvidia and Meta Platforms are still headed by their co-founders. Amazon was also founder-led until relatively recently, and Microsoft and Apple did have long stints with their respective founders (or co-founders) as CEOs before they stepped down.\\nShopify following the same blueprint is no guarantee of success, but it's worth pointing out that the e-commerce specialist has made it its goal to become a 100-year company. Few can come anywhere close to that, but Shopify is off to a pretty good start.\\nOne issue Shopify had was a lack of profitability. The company recently made some changes to its business that are helping on that front. Shopify sold its logistics business, a low-margin unit that was harming its bottom line. Since then, the company's margins and profits have looked much better. In the third quarter, Shopify's revenue grew by 26% year over year to $2.2 billion. Shopify's net income was up 15% year over year to $828 million.\\nIt had a 19% free cash flow margin, up from the 16% reported in the prior-year quarter. Shopify has increased its free cash flow margin sequentially during every quarter this year. No wonder the stock is up substantially year to date. More importantly, Shopify is still looking at a vast runway ahead. The growth of the e-commerce industry should provide the company with a powerful tailwind in the next decade and beyond. It allows people to do business with consumers or companies that would otherwise be beyond their reach.\\nIt also helps businesses save money on overhead costs, savings they can pass on to consumers. And despite its seeming ubiquity, e-commerce still has miles of growth left. Online transactions accounted for just 16.2% of total retail sales in the third quarter in the U.S. Further, Shopify benefits from a competitive advantage. Its app store has a network effect: The more developers within its ecosystem, the more it attracts merchants, and vice versa. The company's main e-commerce offering benefits from switching costs.\\nSo, Shopify has many of the traits necessary to deliver market-beating returns over the long run: profitable growth, a long-term vision, plenty of opportunities, and a moat that will protect its leadership position in its niche. The company looks well on its way to becoming a trillion-dollar stock within 15 years.\\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

On the one hand, a more pro-growth administration will reduce and simplify the abundance of federal and local regulations that hamper new launch and development efforts and increase the costs for businesses. It could also lead to even more privatization of US space operations and greater federal funding support for space companies developing dual-use technologies. On the other hand, strong deregulation could prioritize growth over environmental protections. It could also pose challenges to the Earth observation sector and other climate monitoring technology.\\nAnother key question is how much more dominant will SpaceX become in the next four years? The company is already the apex player in launch (the modern space economy wouldn’t even exist without the Falcon 9), so will its few competitors be innovative and strategic enough to keep up with the major growth that is coming?\\nMusk’s close ties to the president-elect are only part of the equation here. The arrival of Starship will have a monumental impact on the space economy by accelerating growth in existing markets, enabling entirely new industries, and making existing infrastructure obsolete.\\nAs we look ahead, here are 10 predictions for the space capital markets in 2025.\\n1. The next four years\\nUnder the new administration, expect an even greater focus on promoting the space economy and on commercial space integration into government programs. Given Musk’s role in the administration and as one of the largest donors of the campaign, SpaceX will be the greatest beneficiary, but others will benefit as well, most notably from a light-touch regulatory regime for novel space activities overseen by the Commerce.\\n2. Starship comes online\\nStarship will reach orbit and begin operational flights in the first half of 2025, carrying Starlink V2 satellites. With its rapidly accelerating test program reaching a nearly monthly launch cadence in 2024, Starship will double its flight rate in 2025, aided by less regulatory resistance from the FAA, which Musk will have influence over in his new role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\\nSign in to access your portfolio'}, {'title': 'Is Amazon.com (AMZN) AI News Should Pay Attention To?', 'link': 'https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-com-amzn-ai-news-143544504.html', 'content': 'We recently published a list of 15 AI News You Should Pay Attention To.

Here's What Investors Need to Know | The Motley Fool\", 'link': 'https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/11/23/can-walmart-win-market-share-from-amazon/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=8fe741a7-1f7c-4a21-979c-abe544394b9b', 'content': \"KEY POINTS\\nWalmart (WMT 2.32%) may be the largest company in the U.S. by sales, but it keeps making its top line bigger. For a while, it looked like competitor Amazon (AMZN -0.64%) was poised to overtake it, but Walmart is just too big and doing too well to catch. It's a battle of true titans, as both companies boast more than $600 billion in revenues over the last four quarters.\\nWalmart delivered another outstanding quarterly report last week, and the growth drivers behind the results might surprise you. Two factors helping it along are e-commerce growth and an improving ability to attract higher-income customers -- areas that have not historically been among its strong points. But Walmart has been making strategic changes in its e-commerce business, and it's taking off. Can Walmart flip its business and challenge Amazon in e-commerce?\\nWalmart was late to the e-commerce boom, so it missed out on some early opportunities to dominate it. As the largest retailer in the U.S., it could have had an edge. However, it has been developing a strong e-commerce business over the past few years. It was already well positioned when the pandemic struck and customers switched to online shopping, and although it's way behind Amazon, it's still in second place.\\nIn its fiscal 2025 third quarter, which ended Oct. 31, total sales were up 5.5% year over year, but e-commerce sales were up 27%. In the U.S., sales were up 5.3% while e-commerce sales were up 22%. Management called out several growth drivers in the report: in-store order fulfillment, in-store pickup, advertising, and marketplace.\\nIn its international segment, e-commerce revenues increased 43% year over year, driven by in-store order fulfillment, in-store pickup, and marketplace. Meanwhile, for its Sam's Club subsidiary -- a warehouse membership chain similar to Costco Wholesale -- e-commerce sales increased 26%, a gain notably powered by in-store order fulfillment and pickup.\\nManagement attributed much of that performance improvement to its growing ability to attract higher-income customers through strategies such as expanding its product lines in areas that appeal to them. It said that population accounted for 75% of Walmart's market share gains in the quarter.\\nWalmart's e-commerce business isn't profitable yet, but it has the money to keep scaling it until it is -- and management is confident that it will get there.\\nWalmart's e-commerce growth might be outpacing Amazon's. Although the metrics might not be directly comparable, Amazon's net sales from its online stores increased by 7% in the third quarter, while revenues from third-party sellers increased 10% and advertising sales increased by 19%.\\nWalmart isn't likely to catch up to Amazon in online sales anytime soon. Last year, Amazon was responsible for 37.6% of U.S. e-commerce sales, while Walmart's share was just 6.4%, according to a Statista report. But it could be capturing more market share, and at Walmart's level, the dollar amount is huge.\\nWith its network of more than 4,600 stores in the U.S., Walmart has some edges over Amazon. Amazon can't offer the same in-store pickup options and other omnichannel benefits that physical retailers like Walmart provide. That may not be enough to outweigh the edges Amazon derives from its logistics network or its Prime membership program, but it ensures that Walmart will keep a certain share of e-commerce sales from shoppers who prefer the benefits of physical stores.\\nWalmart is still a much larger company than Amazon, and instead of losing market share, it looks like it's gaining. I have hypothesized for a while that Amazon is going to overtake Walmart, but although the gap is still closing, (mostly due to Amazon's non-e-commerce segments), it's taking a lot longer than I thought it would. With its strong e-commerce business, Walmart might fend off Amazon even longer.\\nWMT REVENUE (TTM) DATA BY YCHARTS\\nWalmart's phenomenal results were reported at the same time as competitor Target, which had a completely different experience over the same time period. Its e-commerce division is growing faster than Amazon, Target, and Costco.\\nBut while Walmart stock has been looking more attractive lately, it's not cheap. It trades at a P/E ratio of 36, which is higher than its five-year average of 31.\\nThis may not be the best time to buy. However, Walmart is a long-term play, and it also pays a reliably growing dividend. This all-weather stock is beating the market this year, up 67%. That's better than many growth stocks. You could buy it at any time and accrue steady gains over many years.\\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Billionaire investors conduct careful research into every stock they buy, which is why it's worth checking out what they are buying (or selling). Fortunately, investment firms that manage more than $100 million are required to disclose their holdings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\\nThree Motley Fool contributors combed through the holdings of a select group of billionaire managers. Here's why the stars are aligning for Amazon (AMZN -0.64%), Nike (NKE 3.06%), and Philip Morris International (PM -0.93%).\\nJohn Ballard (Amazon): Amazon has been a phenomenal investment over the last few decades. But great businesses with strong competitive advantages usually keep finding ways to deliver returns to investors. Amazon is proving it belongs in that category. Its market cap recently hit $2.1 trillion, and a deeper look at what's going on in the company shows the shares could be worth substantially more in the years to come.\\nAmazon is mostly known for its online retail business, which generated more than 38% of the company's revenue last quarter. But it's also on pace to be one of the leaders in retail media with one of the fastest-growing markets in advertising. The company is leveraging its high-traffic online store to rake in billions of ad revenue from sellers, publishers, and others. In the last quarter, Amazon's ad revenue grew 19% year over year (excluding currency changes) to reach an annual run rate of $57 billion.\\nAmazon's non-retail services, including advertising and cloud computing, generate most of the company's total revenue. Because these services generate higher margins than retail sales, the strong growth from the opportunities in retail media and cloud computing are helping grow the company's profits.\\nAmazon generated a staggering $49 billion in free cash flow over the last year. This is why the stock commands a $2.1 trillion market cap. Clearly, Amazon is going to continue growing its non-retail revenue at high rates, since the advertising and cloud opportunities are still in the early innings of their long-term growth, which should make Amazon even more valuable to investors down the road.\\nSome highly regarded investment managers were taking profits in the third quarter, but billionaire Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management added to his firm's stake. I side with Coleman and believe Amazon shares are a solid buy.\\nJennifer Saibil (Nike): Nike is the largest activewear company by far, and it has no match in any competitor. The second largest activewear company, Adidas, has literally half of Nike's sales -- $25 billion versus $50 billion over the trailing 12 months. So even though Nike's sales have been declining, down 10% in the 2025 fiscal first quarter (ended Aug. 31), it's the unquestionable leader in the industry with the brand presence and assets to keep its top spot and return to growth.\\nIt's not surprising that billionaire Bill Ackman, who manages Pershing Square Capital, would take a chance on the rebound. Ackman has taken activist positions before, and he recently added to his stake in Nike from 3,040,132 shares to 16,280,338 shares, a 436% increase.\\nAlthough Nike has been struggling through the inflationary environment, it made some critical decisions a few years ago to curtail some of its wholesale partnerships in favor of bolstering its direct-to-consumer business. At the time, it was making a big push for its digital channels with a membership program, exclusive product drops, and more. But it didn't account for changing shopping trends, which include browsing and buying from physical athletic wear stores. The company also shifted resources away from innovation. That left a wide niche for its competitors to exploit, and they have, with many smaller brands like Berkshire Hathaway's Brooks and On Holding garnering greater market share.\\nNike is already making changes. It has a new CEO in longtime executive Elliott Hill, and the company is working on revitalizing its wholesale partner program. Part of the recent sales drop has been due to rebalancing investments away from current channels and product development and toward wholesale channels and new product lines.\\nNike stock is down 32% this year and trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21. Investors with a long time horizon can feel comfortable following Ackman into a chance on a Nike rebound.\\nJeremy Bowman (Philip Morris International): Philip Morris International has been a top performer this year as the international seller of cigarette brands like Marlboro has successfully pivoted to next-gen products like Iqos heat-not-burn stocks and Zyn nicotine pouches. The stock is now up 38% year to date.\\nBillionaire investors have taken notice of that strategy, and among those buying the stock in Q3 were Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office, Ken Griffin's Citadel Advisors, and Rajiv Jain GQG Partners.\\nPhilip Morris offers a rare combination of growth, income, and safety. Like its tobacco-stock peers, the company has long been a reliable dividend payer, and it currently offers a dividend yield of 4.2% after raising the dividend by 4%, continuing a long history of dividend hikes.\\nIn Q3, Philip Morris reported organic revenue growth, which excludes currency fluctuations, of 11.6% to $9.9 billion. Organic operating income rose 13.8% to $3.7 billion, driving adjusted earnings per share up 14% to $1.91. Those results beat analyst estimates.\\nMuch of that growth was driven by its next-gen business as heated tobacco unit shipments rose 8.9%, and its oral smoke-free products shipments rose 22.2%. Philip Morris's smoke-free business now accounts for 38% of revenue and 40% of its gross profit.\\nThe company is ramping up production of Zyn pouches with new investments in plants in the U.S., and it acquired the rights to sell Iqos in the U.S.\\nAt a time when the traditional tobacco industry is under pressure, Philip Morris has tapped into a new growth market, and it's paying off for investors.\\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

While they have very different businesses, shares of both companies have accelerated over the past year. (Home Depot stock is up 33%, and Amazon has gained 38%, as of this writing, Nov. 19.)\\nHere\\'s the case for both of these consumer goods juggernauts, and why one looks like the better stock to buy right now.\\nAmazon holds a commanding 40% of the U.S. e-commerce market, leaps and bounds ahead of fellow retail competitor Walmart\\'s 7.4%. The company\\'s latest quarter highlights its impressive position.\\nAmazon\\'s North American sales popped 11% in the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, to $95.5 billion. Investors wondering if the company can continue to fend off rivals need to look no further than Amazon\\'s new launch of its ultra-cheap products through Amazon Haul. The mobile-only marketplace competes with the low-priced marketplaces Shein and Temu, and all prices are under $20.\\nOf course, there\\'s far more to Amazon than just its retail sales. The company\\'s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the leading cloud company, with 31% of the market. Cloud computing was already a fast-growing market, but it\\'s being supercharged by artificial intelligence (AI). Goldman Sachs estimates cloud computing will grow into a $2 trillion market by 2030, thanks to AI.\\nAWS sales increased 19% in the third quarter to $27.5 billion. With AI fueling more investments in cloud computing, Amazon should continue to benefit.\\nHome Depot is just coming off a solid third quarter, ended Oct. 27, where revenue and earnings beat Wall Street\\'s expectations. Sales rose 6.6% to $40.2 billion, ahead of analysts\\' consensus estimates of $39.3 billion. Similarly, the company\\'s diluted GAAP earnings per share of $3.67 outpaced the consensus estimate of $3.64.\\nThe company is in a strong position in the home improvement space, with an estimated 28% of the market in 2023, compared to just 17% for Lowe\\'s. Home Depot also has impressive margins: Its operating margin is 13.5%, with $5.4 billion in operating income.\\nHome Depot\\'s management says there\\'s pent-up demand for home renovations, which could boost the company\\'s growth whenever it comes. Speaking about its customers\\' desire to work on projects, Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail told CNBC recently: \"There is demand for remodeling, and they are putting it on hold until they see a more favorable financing environment. And so the demand is there; the question is when it\\'s unlocked.\"\\nThat\\'s the current drawback for Home Depot. With mortgage rates and borrowing costs for home equity loans still elevated, Home Depot customers remain cautious about spending. If interest rates fall next year, it will likely spur a surge of renovations and home sales (both great for Home Depot), but it\\'s not here just yet.\\nAmazon\\'s shares currently have a price-to-earnings ratio of 43, compared to 27 for Home Depot. That makes Home Depot technically cheaper right now than Amazon -- but that doesn\\'t necessarily make it the better buy.\\nThe Federal Reserve has already cut the federal funds rate twice over the past few months, and mortgage rates have actually increased. That\\'s because mortgage rates aren\\'t directly tied to the federal funds rate and are also influenced by bond yields, which have gone up, taking rates with them.\\nEven if more rate cuts come next year, it\\'s not guaranteed to solve high borrowing costs. Home Depot needs consumers to feel comfortable spending on big home improvement projects again, and there\\'s no telling when that will happen.\\nMeanwhile, Amazon is already benefiting from its e-commerce lead, and the demand for AI cloud computing is expanding the company\\'s opportunities.

That could have turned an investment of $1,000 into more than $42 million. The same investment in the S&P 500 index would have grown to just $308,115 over the same period.\\nBuffett's simple long-term investing strategy is the secret to Berkshire's success. He likes companies with steady growth, reliable profitability, strong management teams, and shareholder-friendly initiatives like dividends and stock buybacks. You will never see him and his team piling money into the latest stock market trends -- even one as powerful as artificial intelligence (AI).\\nHowever, four stocks in Berkshire's $292 billion portfolio of publicly listed securities are deploying AI into their legacy businesses in unique ways.\\nIMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL.\\nDomino's Pizza (DPZ 1.68%) is the world's largest pizza chain with over 21,000 stores in 90 countries, which serve more than 1 million customers every day. Berkshire just added this stock to its portfolio in the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), which might be a great sign for the pizza giant considering the conglomerate was a net seller of stocks overall.\\nDomino's puts technologies like AI at the center of its operations, because they drive efficiency, which lowers costs and boosts profits. Thanks to the predictive capabilities of AI, it can start making pizzas before a customer even finishes placing an order. That means each pizza is cooked sooner and reaches the customer faster than ever.\\nThe company also uses Microsoft's Azure OpenAI platform for the computing infrastructure and software required to create powerful AI assistants for its website, which can help customers with their orders. Lastly, AI is going to streamline operations in each store by helping managers save time on day-to-day tasks like inventory management and employee scheduling.\\nAmazon (AMZN -0.64%) is the world's largest e-commerce company, but most investors are more focused on its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business, which is trying to dominate the three core layers of AI:\\nDuring the recent third quarter of 2024, Amazon said AI revenue within AWS grew by a triple-digit percentage compared to a year ago, and it's growing more than three times faster than the cloud division did at the same stage of its evolution.\\nBerkshire invested in Amazon stock in 2019, and Buffett has expressed regret for not identifying the opportunity sooner. Even though it represents only 0.7% of the conglomerate's portfolio, it could still deliver spectacular returns over the long run thanks to AI.\\nBerkshire acquired 400 million shares in Coca-Cola (KO 0.25%) between 1988 and 1994 at a cost of $1.3 billion. It still holds all of them, and they are now worth $24.7 billion! AI certainly wasn't on Buffett's mind when he decided to invest in the soda giant back then, but it's playing an increasingly important role in the business today.\\nLast year, Coca-Cola appointed a chief of generative AI. So far, the company has used the technology to create marketing campaigns and make a promotional version of its flagship soda called Coca-Cola Y3000. It captures what the drink might taste like in the year 3000 by using AI to analyze high volumes of customer data.\\nBack in April, Coca-Cola also struck a five-year $1.1 billion deal with Microsoft Azure to improve its supply chains, marketing, and productivity.\\nApple (AAPL 0.59%) is Berkshire's largest holding. The stock used to account for almost 50% of the conglomerate's entire portfolio, but Buffett sold more than half of his position during the first three quarters of 2024. We don't exactly know why, but Buffett has mentioned at least part of the reason for selling was that he thinks the capital gains tax could rise in the future, so it's beneficial to take profits now.\\nThe timing is certainly interesting. On the one hand, the S&P 500 is expensive right now with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 25.6, which is a 41% premium to its long-term average of 18.1. On the other hand, Apple is on the cusp of realizing an enormous opportunity within the AI space, which could fuel a significant device upgrade cycle over the next few years.\\nThe company recently started rolling out its Apple Intelligence software in the latest versions of its iPhone, iPad, and Mac computer lineup. It was developed in partnership with OpenAI. It allows users to summarize messages and emails with a single tap, and it can generate text and images. Plus, Apple's Siri voice assistant will now draw on the knowledge of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which will make it more powerful than ever.\\nAlthough Berkshire has been a heavy seller of Apple stock lately, Buffett expects it to remain the conglomerate's largest holding for now. Therefore, the investing legend is still likely to do very well if Apple's AI efforts pay off.\\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The steepness of those lines shows how persistent the favorable revisions trend has been, with analysts seemingly struggling to catch up with how strong underlying business trends have been for Nvidia.\\nNvidia’s stock market momentum has made its market capitalization the highest of the Magnificent 7 group at $3.59 trillion, surpassing Apple at $3.45 trillion and Microsoft at $3.07 trillion. Investors’ lukewarm reaction suggests that they have become used to getting far bigger guidance upgrades than what they received this time around. Nvidia’s upgraded guidance is solid, but relatively underwhelming by the company’s own standards.\\nWe don’t want to come across as making too big of a deal of the stock’s reaction to the quarterly results. After all, Nvidia shares are up +191.3% over the past year and have handily outperformed the Zacks Tech sector (up +32.5%), the S&P 500 index (up +30.4%), and the Mag 7 group (up +20.6%).\\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\\nBeyond Nvidia, the focus lately has been on the Retail sector, with several major conventional operators coming out with quarterly results.
